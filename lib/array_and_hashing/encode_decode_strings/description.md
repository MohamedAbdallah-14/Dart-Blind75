[lintcode Link](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/659)

    Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a string. The encoded string is then sent over the network and is decoded back to the original list of strings.

###Example 1:

    Input: ["lint","code","love","you"]
    Output: ["lint","code","love","you"]
    Explanation:
    One possible encode method is: "lint:;code:;love:;you"

###Example 2:

    Input: ["we", "say", ":", "yes"]
    Output: ["we", "say", ":", "yes"]
    Explanation:
    One possible encode method is: "we:;say:;:::;yes"
