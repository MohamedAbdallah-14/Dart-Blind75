# Dart-Blind75

## Overview
This repository contains solutions to problems from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/) written in Dart. The problems are organized according to the [neetCode roadmap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap). Each problem has its own directory containing a Dart solution file, a description file with the LeetCode problem description and link, and a solution file with the solution's intuition, approach, complexity analysis, and code.

- `<problem name>`.dart: the Dart solution file
- description.md: the LeetCode problem description and link
- solution.md: the solution's intuition, approach, complexity analysis, and code

## Running the Tests
The test file for each problem is located in the `test` directory and is named after the problem with a z suffix. To run the tests for a specific problem, use the following command:

```dart test/`<problem name>`_test.dart```
